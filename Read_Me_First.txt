Hello,

Thank you for the oportunity to interview with your company.

The CRUD app I created is a simple application that tracks a persons prescription medications.

Here are the steps to get this app running.

1.) Please update dbconf.php with your MySQL credentials.
2.) Execute database.sql to create the tables for the application as well as populate some sample data.
3.) username: admin@admin.com 
    password: admin1234
4.) You can also register a new account and add new data.
5.) If you have php > 5.4, you should be able to run the project with: php -S localhost:8000

6.) Please feel free to reach out to josephsortino@hotmail.com for any questions.


Thanks,
Joseph Sortino
